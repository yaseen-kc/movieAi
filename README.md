## Project Setup

Before starting the project, please add the `.env` file and add your TMDB and OpenAI API keys into it.

### Steps for Vite-based `.env` Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (same level as `vite.config.js`).

2. Add the following keys to the `.env` file:

```env

VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key

VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

```

3. Vite automatically injects variables starting with `VITE_` into the application, so you can access these values in your code using `import.meta.env`.

For example:

```javascript
const tmdbApiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_TMDB_API_KEY;

const openAiApiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY;
```
